"""Launch-time coherence warnings.

The SDK already defaults the safe things (strips --enable-automation, denies WebRTC leak, disables
Privacy Sandbox, matches the persona to the build). What it CAN'T fix is an operator passing an
incoherent or missing-recommended combination - a proxy with no geo, a spoofed OS the host can't
font-match, a GPU string that contradicts the platform, etc. coherence_warnings() spots those at
launch() and emit_coherence_warnings() prints an actionable line to stderr.

Never blocks the launch; suppressible with quiet=True or CLEARCOTE_NO_WARN=1. coherence_warnings()
is a pure function (no I/O) so it is trivially unit-testable.
