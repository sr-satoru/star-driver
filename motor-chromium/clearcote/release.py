checksums + GPG signatures live on each release page.

# The catalog is the source of truth for "which browser majors exist and what tier each is". The SDK
# fetches it at runtime so a NEW release becomes switchable (launch(version="150")) without an SDK
# bump. Each build declares a `tier`: FREE builds are public on GitHub and carry their url+sha256; PRO
# builds (license-gated, not yet public) advertise existence ONLY — the SDK validates the request and
# routes the actual download through the authenticated /api/v1/download/pro route. When a PRO major is
# later promoted to public, flip its `tier` to "free" and add the GitHub url — no SDK change needed.
#
# platform keys are "windows"/"linux" (matching the /download/pro `platform` param).

# actually DOWNLOADABLE: when a new build (e.g. the 150 PRO) goes live, add it to the live catalog
# (/api/v1/versions) — no SDK republish needed — and to this snapshot on the next SDK release.
