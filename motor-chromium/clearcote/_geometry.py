"""Headless window geometry.

Headed launches take their geometry from the real display and the SDK keeps the page on it
(``no_viewport``), so ``screen`` / ``avail`` / ``inner`` / ``outer`` agree by construction. Headless
has no display, and what it reports depends on whether the engine's persona machinery is running.
Regime 1 was measured on 149.0.7827.114/linux-x64, regime 2 on win-x64 149 and 153 (below).

REGIME 1 — a persona is active (``--fingerprint=<seed>`` on the command line).
    The engine spoofs ``screen`` AND ``avail`` from the seed, including a taskbar
    (seed A -> 1920x1080 / avail 1920x1040, seed B -> 2560x1440 / 1400, seed C -> 1600x900 / 860),
    and its values BEAT a CDP screen override — so the SDK must not try to set screen here, it would
    silently lose. What it must not do either is leave Playwright's emulated viewport on: that gives
    ``inner`` 1280x720 inside an ``outer`` of 1920x1040, i.e. 640px of window unaccounted for by any
    frame a real browser has. So: ``no_viewport`` (``inner`` tracks the real window) plus one window
    resize to the persona's own work area, which yields a maximized window::

        screen 1920x1080   avail 1920x1040   inner 1920x919   outer 1920x1007   frame (0, 88)

    That frame delta is the engine's own, and it matches real captures (dx 0 maximized / 16 floating,
    dy 87-95 on Windows) far better than anything the SDK could impose.

REGIME 2 — no persona (the default seedless launch, ``light_stealth``, which drops
``--fingerprint`` deliberately, and a ``fingerprint_profile`` / ``profile="auto"`` launch without a
seed — measured: an imported profile only supplies screen/avail when a persona is ALSO running, so
without a seed its display is inert and this regime applies. When a profile is present its own screen
is used instead of a corpus pick.).
    Nothing spoofs ``screen``, so a page sees the 800x600 headless surface, and Playwright's
    emulated viewport then synthesizes a window on top of it::

        screen 1280x720   avail 1280x720   inner 1280x720   outer 1288x851   <- outer > screen

    A window larger than its own screen is not a statistical tell but an impossible state, readable
    in two property lookups. It was present on every headless shape reachable through the SDK
    (default viewport, explicit viewport, ``no_viewport``, ``no_viewport`` + ``--window-size``).
    The fix is ``--screen-info``, which makes the headless DISPLAY a real-machine size (with a
    taskbar on Windows) before the first document exists, then the same ``no_viewport`` + work-area
    fit as regime 1. Measured on 153.0.8010.36/win-x64, persistent and non-persistent contexts::

        screen 1920x1080  avail 1920x1040  inner 1904x911  outer 1920x1040   (popups clamp inside it)

    This used to be a CDP screen override (Playwright's ``screen`` option) with the viewport sized as
    screen minus a hardcoded engine frame. Two faults: the override forces ``avail == screen`` (no
    taskbar, a minority shape), and the frame around an emulated viewport is per-platform — 8x131 on
    linux-x64 but 16x134 on win-x64 (measured on 149.0.7827.114 and 153.0.8010.36) — so on Windows
    the window landed 8x3 px past the screen edge. With a real display nothing is sized against the
    frame. (The engine's ``--fingerprint-screen-*`` switches are no substitute: device-width media
    queries keep answering 800x600.)

    PARITY: the seed still selects the same screen row in every SDK (``headless_geometry``); only
    how it is applied changed.

PROVENANCE of the regime-2 table: the ``audit_profiles`` corpus (real captures from the public
fingerprint audit), desktop rows whose geometry is self-consistent and which are not themselves
emulated-viewport captures, counted by distinct /24 so one busy machine cannot skew it. Regenerate
with ``scripts/derive-headless-geometry.cjs``. Three deliberate deviations, because the corpus
samples an audit site's visitors rather than the web:

* macOS rows dropped — they report ``color_depth`` 30, which this engine cannot spoof, so a macOS
  screen size would contradict the depth the page actually reads.
* Non-1.0 device-pixel-ratio rows dropped (e.g. the common Windows ``1536x864 @1.25``). DPR is
  reachable over CDP, but scaling changes what the rasterizer produces, and an unverified DPR is a
  worse trade than a slightly narrower screen pool.
* Ultrawide ``3440x1440`` capped to weight 2 (the corpus has 12 distinct /24s on it — developers
  over-represent ultrawides; uncapped it would be picked for ~1 launch in 5).
