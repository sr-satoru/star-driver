      * fabrication rewrites what the browser *reports*, which beats a page reading the candidate;
      * this policy stops UDP *leaving the machine*, which beats a server watching where packets
        arrive from.

    A page that sets ``iceTransportPolicy: "relay"`` forces the browser to talk to its own TURN
    server. TURN prefers UDP and an HTTP/SOCKS proxy carries only TCP, so that UDP left on the
    host's own path and the TURN server read the real public address straight off the packet -- no
    candidate involved, so fabricating one changed nothing. Reported by a customer whose session was
    flagged for location spoofing with an otherwise perfectly coherent persona.

    Worse, ``geoip=True`` sets ``webrtc_ip`` for you, so the more carefully a caller configured for
    coherence the more likely they had silently lost this. Now only an explicit policy from the
