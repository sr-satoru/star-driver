"""Humanized input + cursor visualization (Python).

``humanize=True`` installs ONE consistent human-input standard that covers moving, clicking,
dragging, scrolling and typing — dispatched as native trusted input (isTrusted=True,
navigator.webdriver stays False). It works whether you drive the page directly or via locators:

  * page level   — page.click / page.hover / page.dblclick / page.type / page.fill / page.press,
                   page.mouse.move / mouse.click / mouse.wheel and held-button drags
                   (mouse.down → mouse.move → mouse.up), page.keyboard.type
  * locator level — locator.click / type / fill / hover / dblclick / press /
                    press_sequentially / clear / check / uncheck / tap / drag_to
                    (routed through the humanized page methods; main-frame locators only,
                    with a safe fall-through to native for anything exotic)

``show_cursor=True`` injects a red cursor dot that follows the real mousemove events.

Design notes:
  * Mouse moves build an eased, slightly bowed cubic-bezier path SDK-side from the *tracked*
    cursor position (continuous — no snap back to the 0,0 corner between moves) using
    Playwright's NATIVE mouse.move. Because it is native input, the button state is carried
    correctly: down() → move() → up() is a real held-button drag (sliders work) with no
    separate CDP channel to desync.
  * Typing goes key-by-key through Playwright's native keyboard (trusted, shift handled by the
    engine) with randomized inter-key timing, occasional thinking pauses, and a small
    fat-finger-then-correct chance.

    A <select> that has focus and is CLOSED steps through its options on ArrowUp/ArrowDown, and the
