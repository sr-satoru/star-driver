"""Profile library: index, host-coherence scoring, and selection.

Port of the Node SDK's ``profilelib.ts``. The two must stay behaviourally identical — a
persona chosen on one SDK should be the persona chosen on another for the same host and key,
or a customer switching languages silently changes identity.

The persona path this serves is ``--fingerprint-profile`` **without** ``--fingerprint``. That
distinction is load-bearing: measured against a strict anti-bot device check, a seed persona failed
13/13 while a profile-only persona passed. With no seed the farbling machinery never engages, so
canvas/WebGL/audio readbacks come back byte-identical to an unmodified browser — the profile is
static value substitution over a real capture rather than perturbation of this machine's.

SELECTION IS ABOUT COHERENCE WITH *THIS HOST*, NOT ABOUT MATCHING AN OS STRING. A profile
claiming an RTX 3080 on an Intel UHD host says NVIDIA in the strings and paints Intel pixels — a
contradiction readable in one call. So the GPU term dominates, and ``browser_major`` is a HARD
filter: a Chrome-138 capture on a 150 engine reports UA 138 while the engine behaves like 150.

ROTATION IS PER-IDENTITY, NOT PER-LAUNCH. Always serving the single best profile makes every
customer on similar hardware converge on one identity, and that shared fingerprint becomes its
own signal. But re-rolling every launch is worse: an account whose device changes on every visit
is a harder tell than a slightly-suboptimal stable one. So the default ("rotate") is sticky per
key — the same key always resolves to the same profile, different keys spread across the top-N.
