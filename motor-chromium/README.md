# clearcote (Python SDK)

A **Playwright drop-in** for [Clearcote](https://github.com/clearcotelabs/clearcote-browser) — the
open, reproducible, anti-fingerprint Chromium build. `launch()` returns a standard Playwright
`Browser`, so migrating is a one-line import change.

The verified Clearcote binary is **auto-downloaded and SHA-256 checked** on first use, then cached —
no zips or paths to manage. Or run the same code on a hosted Clearcote browser with
`launch(cloud=True)`: see [Local or cloud](#local-or-cloud).

> **Platform:** Clearcote ships **Windows x64** and **Linux x64** binaries; `launch()` runs on both
> and the SDK auto-downloads the right one for your OS. On Linux the persona is Linux-native (Linux
> GPU/voices/audio-device values) and DRM uses the Linux CDM. macOS is on the
> [roadmap](../../ROADMAP.md). On a minimal Linux host, install the browser's runtime libs (e.g.
> `apt-get install -y libnss3 libnspr4 libgbm1 libasound2 libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libcups2
> libdrm2 libxkbcommon0 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxrandr2 libxfixes3 libxext6 libpango-1.0-0
> libcairo2 libx11-6 libxcb1 libexpat1 libdbus-1-3`) and pass `args=["--no-sandbox"]` (or
> `chown root:root chrome-sandbox && chmod 4755 chrome-sandbox`) in containers.
> Running as **root** in a container? Run as a normal user (the official Docker image does) or add
> `--cap-add=SYS_NICE`: the open build is compiled with debug assertions, and a root container that
> refuses Chromium's process-priority call stops it at start.

## Install

```bash
pip install clearcote
```

`playwright` is pulled in as a dependency. You do **not** need to run `playwright install`
(Clearcote uses its own browser binary, not Playwright's bundled Chromium).

## Usage

```python
from clearcote import launch

browser = launch(
    fingerprint="user-7423",        # per-eTLD+1 seed: same seed => same identity, different => unlinkable
    platform="windows",
    timezone="America/New_York",
    headless=False,
)
page = browser.new_page()
page.goto("https://abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/")
# ... standard Playwright (sync API) from here ...
browser.close()
```

Already using Playwright? Swap `p.chromium.launch(...)` for `launch(...)` from `clearcote` — the
returned object is a normal Playwright `Browser`. (One shared Playwright driver is started lazily
and stopped at interpreter exit.)

### Async API (`clearcote.async_api`)

Inside an asyncio event loop, use the async API — it mirrors the sync one and returns Playwright
**async** objects (the sync API raises "Sync API inside the asyncio loop"):

```python
import asyncio
from clearcote.async_api import launch

async def main():
    browser = await launch(
        fingerprint="user-7423",
        platform="windows",
        timezone="America/New_York",
    )
    page = await browser.new_page()
    await page.goto("https://abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/")
    # ... standard Playwright (async API) from here ...
    await browser.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Same options as the sync `launch` (fingerprint/persona/proxy/`geoip`/`profile`/`canvas_bridge`/
`humanize`/…). `clearcote.async_api` exposes `launch`, `launch_persistent_context`, `launch_agent`,
`run_agent_task`, `executable_path`, `download`, plus `Profile` (use `launch(profile="name")`). Each
launched browser owns its Playwright driver and stops it on `await browser.close()`.

### Light stealth (`light_stealth=True`)

When the full seed-derived persona is more than a target needs, `light_stealth` spoofs only a
coherent, seed-derived bundle of the *safe* metadata axes — `hardware_concurrency`, `device_memory`,
`color_depth`, `device_pixel_ratio`, `max_touch_points` — via native override switches, leaving
rendering (canvas/WebGL/audio/fonts), TLS and the real browser version untouched. Screen dimensions
stay real by default (opt-in), since a faked screen that can't be reconciled with the real render
surface is a reliable block trigger. It never engages the `--fingerprint` persona machinery.

```python
browser = launch(light_stealth=True, fingerprint="my-seed")   # coherent metadata, rendering left real
```

Or set any native override directly (no seed needed) — an explicit value always wins over the persona:

```python
browser = launch(hardware_concurrency=8, device_memory=8, device_pixel_ratio=1.25, max_touch_points=0)
```

Native overrides: `hardware_concurrency`, `device_memory`, `color_depth`, `device_pixel_ratio`,
`max_touch_points`, and (opt-in) `screen_width` / `screen_height` / `avail_width` / `avail_height`.
Needs the Clearcote 149.0.7827.114 (v0.1.0-pre.22) build or newer.

### Standing CDP endpoint (`serve()`)

Run Clearcote as a **stealthy CDP endpoint** that any existing automation attaches to unchanged —
Playwright's `connect_over_cdp`, `puppeteer.connect`, or browser-use / Crawl4AI / Stagehand. Where
`launch()` spawns a Playwright-owned browser, `serve()` launches the binary **directly** — so
`--enable-automation` is never added and `navigator.webdriver` stays `false`; the port binds to
loopback (`127.0.0.1`) behind an origin allowlist.

```python
from clearcote import serve

srv = serve(fingerprint="seed-123", platform="windows")   # same persona/proxy/geoip options as launch()
print(srv.cdp_url)                                        # http://127.0.0.1:<port>

from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
browser = sync_playwright().start().chromium.connect_over_cdp(srv.cdp_url)   # your code, unchanged
# ... or puppeteer.connect / browser-use / Crawl4AI / Stagehand, pointed at srv.cdp_url ...
srv.close()                                               # or: `with serve(...) as srv:`
```

Or from the shell:

```bash
clearcote-serve --port 9222 --fingerprint seed-123 --platform windows   # prints http://127.0.0.1:9222
```

The returned `Server` exposes `.cdp_url`, `.ws_url()`, and `.close()`, and works as a context manager.

Headless, `serve()` gives the browser a real-size display (the persona's, or one drawn from real
desktops) and maximizes its window onto the work area before any client attaches, so every page,
tab and popup reports a window that fits its screen. Pass `window_size={"width": ..., "height": ...}`
for a smaller window (clamped to the work area), or your own `--window-size` / `--screen-info` in
`args` to opt out.

**Drive it from an AI agent (MCP).** Point Claude Desktop / Cursor / Cline at the
[`clearcote-mcp`](https://github.com/clearcotelabs/clearcote-browser/tree/main/mcp) server
(`pip install clearcote-mcp` or `npx -y clearcote-mcp`) — ~20 tools over one shared stealth browser,
persona set via `CLEARCOTE_*` env.

### Many identities on one endpoint (`serve_multiplex`, `clearcote serve`)

One port, one browser per identity, chosen by the connection URL:

```python
# in another shell:  clearcote serve --port 9222 --idle-timeout 300
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
with sync_playwright() as p:
    a = p.chromium.connect_over_cdp("http://127.0.0.1:9222?fingerprint=acct-1&timezone=Europe/Berlin")
    b = p.chromium.connect_over_cdp("http://127.0.0.1:9222?fingerprint=acct-2&proxy=socks5%3A%2F%2Fu%3Ap%40host%3A1080&geoip=true")
```

- Query options: `fingerprint`, `timezone`, `locale`, `proxy`, `geoip`, plus any fingerprint option in kebab-case (`platform`, `hardware-concurrency`, `allow-third-party-cookies`, ...). Unknown options are rejected (400).
- The same identity reuses its browser. Asking for a running identity with *different* options returns 409 — close it first.
- `GET /` lists running browsers; `POST /fingerprint/<id>/close` stops one; `--idle-timeout <s>` closes a browser after its last client disconnects; `--max-browsers` caps them (default 16).
- Behind a reverse proxy, WebSocket URLs honour `X-Forwarded-Host` / `X-Forwarded-Proto`; add the public name with `--allow-host`.
- Binds `127.0.0.1` by default. Requests a web page could make (cross-site fetches, foreign `Origin`, a `Host` that isn't an IP / `localhost` / allowed) are refused.

In code: `clearcote.serve_multiplex(port=9222, idle_timeout=300, data_dir="./profiles")`.

### `clearcote` command line

```bash
clearcote install [--version 152] [--channel preview]
clearcote info [--quick] [--json] [--proxy <url>]   # alias: doctor
clearcote login [key]      # validates the key, saves it to ~/.clearcote/license.key
clearcote logout
clearcote clear-cache
clearcote serve [--port 9222] ...
clearcote cloud run|sessions|stop|events|recording|profile sync|webhooks ...   # the hosted API, see Local or cloud
```

`info` never downloads: it reports the SDK, the cached builds, which engine features the binary supports, a launch test (skipped with `--quick`), licence seats, fonts and missing system libraries.

### Engine options (PRO 152 r22+)

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `fingerprint="off"` | No persona at all — for telling whether a problem comes from the spoofing or from your environment. |
| `fingerprint_voices=False` | Keep the host's own `speechSynthesis` voices under a persona. |
| `allow_third_party_cookies=True` | Allow third-party cookies (blocked by default), for embedded sign-in, payment and captcha frames. |
| `transparent_proxy=True` | With a proxy: send the headers a direct connection sends, and report connection timing as a reused connection. |

On an older engine each of these is skipped with a warning; the launch still works.

Also: `license_through_proxy=True` (or `CLEARCOTE_LICENSE_THROUGH_PROXY=1`) sends the licence calls through the launch proxy; `release_channel="preview"` (or `CLEARCOTE_RELEASE_CHANNEL`) picks up PRO preview builds; `get_session_seats()` reports seats in use.

### Through a proxy (report the proxy's IP, not your host's)

```python
browser = launch(
    fingerprint="user-7423",
    proxy={"server": "http://host:8080", "username": "u", "password": "p"},  # standard Playwright option
    timezone="America/New_York",
    webrtc_ip="203.0.113.10",       # make WebRTC report the proxy egress IP, not your host's
)
```

**WebRTC won't leak your real IP.** The engine *fabricates* the WebRTC server-reflexive (`srflx`) candidate at `webrtc_ip` and sends **no real STUN** from your host — so WebRTC reports the proxy IP and your real IP never leaks at the packet level. A plain candidate "relabel" doesn't stop the leak (the real STUN packet still goes out from your host); Clearcote sends none. Raw host candidates are suppressed, and the candidate set stays coherent (not empty/disabled).

### Auto geo-match (`geoip`)

Set `geoip=True` and Clearcote resolves the **proxy's exit IP** (looked up *through* the proxy) and auto-fills any unset `timezone`, `accept_language`, `location`, **and `webrtc_ip`** so the whole identity — clock, language, geo, and WebRTC IP — matches the proxy's region:

```python
browser = launch(
    fingerprint="user-7423",
    proxy={"server": "http://host:8080", "username": "u", "password": "p"},
    geoip=True,              # timezone, languages, location, AND WebRTC IP all auto-set to the proxy's geo
)
```

Anything you set explicitly wins over `geoip`. With no proxy it uses your direct connection's IP. The lookup goes through the proxy — http(s) and SOCKS5 (with username/password) alike.

The whole lookup has one deadline, `CLEARCOTE_GEOIP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 20). If the region can't be resolved in time, `launch()` raises `GeoipError` (code `GEOIP_UNRESOLVED`) **before** any browser starts, instead of launching with this machine's clock and language. If you set both `timezone` and `accept_language` yourself, it warns and launches anyway.

Geo data comes from the offline [geoip-all-in-one](https://github.com/daijro/geoip-all-in-one) MaxMind database (downloaded + cached on first use; GPL-3.0 data, the same source Camoufox uses) — more accurate than a single online API — with `ip-api.com` as a fallback.

### Humanized input (`humanize`, `show_cursor`)

```python
browser = launch(fingerprint="user-7423", humanize=True)
page = browser.new_page()
page.goto("https://example.com")

page.click("#login")                       # eased bezier glide, then a trusted click
page.fill("#user", "alice")                # focus + key-by-key typing with human timing
page.locator("#pwd").type("s3cr3t")        # locators are humanized too
page.mouse.wheel(0, 800)                   # eased, multi-step scroll
# a held-button drag (slider captchas): the button stays pressed across the move
page.mouse.move(x0, y0); page.mouse.down(); page.mouse.move(x1, y0); page.mouse.up()
```

`humanize=True` installs **one consistent human-input standard** covering moving, clicking,
dragging, scrolling and typing — all dispatched as **native trusted input** (`isTrusted === true`,
`navigator.webdriver` stays `false`), at both the page level (`page.click`/`hover`/`dblclick`/
`type`/`fill`/`press`, `page.mouse.*`, `page.keyboard.type`) and the locator level
(`locator.click`/`type`/`fill`/`hover`/`press_sequentially`/`drag_to`/`check`/…). Mouse paths are
slightly bowed cubic-beziers built from the *last* cursor position (no snap back to the corner),
walked as a **sum of sub-movements with a min-jerk velocity profile** — a ballistic primary that
slightly over/undershoots plus a corrective move, i.e. the multi-peak velocity of real reaching, not
one symmetric bell. Because they use native input, the button held by `mouse.down()` stays held
across the move, so `down → move → up` is a real drag (slider captchas work). Clicks get an
actionability pre-flight (visible + enabled + stable + not covered) and fall back to the native click
if it fails. Typing goes key-by-key with **gaussian inter-key timing** + word-boundary pauses and the
occasional fat-finger correction; `page.fill` over 200 chars stays atomic (skips per-key typing) to
avoid crawling. Scrolling uses **ease-out inertia** (a fast flick decaying to a slow settle) with the
occasional reading pause.

`show_cursor=True` injects a red cursor dot that follows the real mouse, handy for watching a
headed run. Both default to off; everything stays standard Playwright when `humanize=False`.

### Render-backend coherence check (`check_render_coherence`)

A persona can claim a GPU, but if the page is actually painted by a software rasterizer
(SwiftShader/llvmpipe — common headless with no GPU) a strict detector can tell. Probe a live page:

```python
from clearcote import launch, check_render_coherence

br = launch(fingerprint="user-7423")
page = br.new_page(); page.goto("about:blank")
verdict = check_render_coherence(page)        # {'renderer', 'software_suspected', 'coherent', 'warnings', ...}
if not verdict["coherent"]:
    print(verdict["warnings"])                 # e.g. software rasterizer / incoherent GPU family
```

It reads the (unmasked) WebGL vendor/renderer the page actually sees, flags a software rasterizer (a
fatal headless tell — enable the canvas bridge or run headed on a real GPU) and an incoherent
vendor/renderer pair. Pass `claimed_gpu=...` to also assert the rendered family. The async API
exposes the same as `await clearcote.async_api.check_render_coherence(page)`.

The renderer *string* alone is not enough: a persona renames the backend, so a SwiftShader fallback
stops looking like one. The check therefore also measures limits the string cannot move —
`MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE`, the vertex/fragment uniform-vector pair, and an actual 16384-wide texture
allocation — and reports them as `max_texture_size`, `max_vertex_uniform_vectors`,
`max_fragment_uniform_vectors` and `can_allocate_16k_texture`. A renderer naming a desktop GPU while
`MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE` is below 16384 is a spoof over a software rasterizer and comes back
`coherent: False`. **Headless on Linux with no GPU hits exactly this** — Chromium falls back to
SwiftShader (8192) whatever the persona claims, and no launch flag changes it on a display-less
host. Run headed under Xvfb, or use the canvas bridge.

### Hardened launch defaults

Every `launch()` already does, with no extra options:

- **drops Playwright's `--enable-automation`** so the engine's `AutomationControlled` feature stays
  off (it otherwise flips `navigator.webdriver`-adjacent tells). Pass your own `ignore_default_args`
  to override.
- **disables QUIC/HTTP-3 when a proxy is set**, so no UDP egresses around the proxy (a SOCKS5/HTTP
  proxy carries only TCP) — coherent with proxied Chrome.
- prints a one-line **coherence warning** to stderr for incoherent option combos it can't auto-fix
  (silence with `quiet=True` or `CLEARCOTE_NO_WARN=1`).

### Persistent profile

```python
from clearcote import launch_persistent_context

context = launch_persistent_context(
    "./profile-7423",
    fingerprint="user-7423",
    platform="windows",
)
```

### Widevine / DRM (`widevine=True`)

clearcote ships the **EME/Widevine plumbing** compiled in, but — being 100% open source — it does
**not** bundle Google's proprietary CDM. Pass `widevine=True` on a **persistent** context and the SDK
fetches that CDM once from Google's own component server (same as a real Chrome receives it), seeds it
into the profile, and enables it — so `navigator.requestMediaKeySystemAccess('com.widevine.alpha')`
resolves and DRM streams play, instead of EME being a "no-Widevine" tell.

```python
from clearcote import launch_persistent_context

ctx = launch_persistent_context("./profile-drm", widevine=True)   # fetch + seed + enable the CDM
page = ctx.pages[0] if ctx.pages else ctx.new_page()
page.goto("https://example.com")
ok = page.evaluate("""async () => {
  const a = await navigator.requestMediaKeySystemAccess('com.widevine.alpha',
    [{initDataTypes:['cenc'], videoCapabilities:[{contentType:'video/mp4;codecs="avc1.42E01E"',
      robustness:'SW_SECURE_DECODE'}]}]);
  await a.createMediaKeys(); return true;
}""")
print("Widevine:", ok)            # True
ctx.close()
```

- Requires a **persistent** context (the CDM lives in `user_data_dir`) — not the incognito `launch()`.
- The CDM is cached under `~/.clearcote/WidevineCdm`; fetch it ahead of time with `fetch_widevine()`.
- It's **opt-in**: the clearcote package never distributes Google's CDM — *you* trigger the download.
- Software-secure (L3) playback. Hardware-secure (L1) paths are out of scope.

### AI agent (OpenRouter)

Drive a page with an **in-browser AI agent** — it perceives the live page, asks an LLM what to do,
and executes the steps as real, trusted input through Chrome's Actor framework. Defaults to
[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai); switch models with a single slug.

```python
from clearcote import launch_agent, run_agent_task

ctx = launch_agent(
    agent_llm_key=OPENROUTER_API_KEY,        # turns the agent on
    agent_model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",        # any provider/model slug
)
page = ctx.pages[0] if ctx.pages else ctx.new_page()
page.goto("https://example.com")

result = run_agent_task(page, "Click the 'More information...' link.", max_steps=8)
print(result["success"], result["finalText"], result["steps"])
ctx.close()
```

- `agent_llm_key` is all you need — the engine auto-enables Chrome's Actor framework (no extra flags).
- `agent_llm_url` points at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (default OpenRouter); `agent_tool_mode` is `"tools"` (function-calling) or `"json"`.
- Override the model per task: `run_agent_task(page, goal, model="anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet")`.
- The agent needs a **regular profile** — use `launch_agent` / `launch_persistent_context`, not the incognito `launch()`.
- Without `user_data_dir`, `launch_agent` uses a temp profile and deletes it when the context closes; pass `user_data_dir` to keep logins between runs.

### Capture or import a profile

Instead of the synthetic seed-derived identity, you can have Clearcote present a **real machine's
fingerprint**. Pass it to `launch()` via `fingerprint_profile` — fields present in the profile
**override** the seed-derived persona; **absent fields fall back** to the `fingerprint` seed, so
partial profiles stay coherent.

**1. Capture from a donor Chrome** — open `tools/fingerprint-collect/collect.html` and click
**Capture** (downloads a JSON), or paste the collector script in DevTools. It records an exhaustive
profile (navigator, screen, WebGL, audio, speech voices, fonts, codecs, CSS media, WebGPU, WebRTC).
See the [collector README](../../tools/fingerprint-collect/README.md).

**2. Or convert from the open-source 10k dataset** —
[`chrome-fingerprints`](https://github.com/Vinyzu/chrome-fingerprints):

```bash
pip install chrome-fingerprints
python tools/fingerprint-collect/convert_dataset.py --out ./profiles --count 100
```

**3. Launch with the profile:**

```python
browser = launch(
    fingerprint="seed-1",                 # seeds any field the profile doesn't specify
    fingerprint_profile="profile.json",   # path / dict / JSON string — SDK gzip+base64-encodes it
)
```

## Local or cloud

The same `launch()` runs the browser on this machine or on Clearcote's servers. One flag picks which,
and both return the same Playwright `Browser`:

```python
from clearcote import launch

browser = launch(cloud=True, country="us", identity="acct-1", humanize=True)
page = browser.new_page()
page.goto("https://example.com")
browser.close()                      # disconnects and ends the hosted session
```

Leave `cloud` unset and set `CLEARCOTE_CLOUD=1` to move existing code to the cloud without editing
it. The API key comes from `api_key=` or `CLEARCOTE_API_KEY`, and `CLEARCOTE_API_URL` points the SDK
at another server (https only: plain `http://` is accepted for `127.0.0.1`, `::1` and `localhost`
alone, so the key never crosses a network unencrypted). `clearcote.async_api.launch(cloud=True)` is
the asyncio twin.

What changes in the cloud:

- **Options.** `fingerprint`, `identity`, `platform`, `brand`, `timezone`, `locale` (or
  `accept_language`), `geoip`, `headless`, `light_stealth`, `proxy` (`"managed"`, a URL, or
  `{server, username, password}`), `country`/`state`/`city`, `proxy_session`, `timeout_sec`,
  `idle_timeout_sec`, `max_gb`, `version`, `profile`, `url`, `adblock`, `keep_alive`, `record`,
  `note`, `worker`. `humanize` and `show_cursor` run in the SDK, exactly as for a local browser.
- **Local-only options are refused, by name.** `executable_path`, `args`, `user_data_dir`,
  `extensions`, `ignore_default_args`, the finer persona switches (`gpu_vendor`, `webrtc_ip`, ...)
  and the licence options raise `ValueError("<name> is not available for cloud browsers")` before
  anything starts.
- **Profiles are cloud profiles.** `profile="acct-1"` loads the cookies of a named cloud profile, and
  `launch_persistent_context(cloud=True, profile="acct-1")` returns a context that also saves them
  back when it closes. Fill one from a browser you are logged in to with `profiles.sync` (below).
- **The session.** `browser.cloud_session` holds its `id`, `worker` and `expiresAt`. `close()`
  disconnects and ends the session; a `keep_alive=True` session is left running (stop it with
  `Cloud().browsers.stop(id)`).

### The Cloud client

Everything else the hosted API does is on `Cloud` (and `AsyncCloud`, the same methods awaitable):

```python
from clearcote.cloud import Cloud

cloud = Cloud()                                   # CLEARCOTE_API_KEY

# An agent run: a task in, JSON out
run = cloud.runs.create(
    "Log in with {{password}} and read the current plan's price",
    url="https://example.com/login",
    schema={"type": "object", "properties": {"price": {"type": "string"}}},
    secrets={"password": {"value": "s3cret", "domains": ["example.com"]}},  # the model never sees it
)
print(run["status"], run["result"]["output"], run["costEur"]["total"])

# Copy a logged-in state into a cloud profile: only the cookies a browser would use on the domains
# you name (theirs, their subdomains', and parent-domain ones such as .example.com for www.example.com)
cloud.profiles.sync("acct-1", login_url="https://example.com/login", domains=["example.com"])

# Recordings, the event timeline, hand-off to a person
s = cloud.browsers.create(record=True)
cloud.browsers.events(s["id"])                    # {"events": [...], "next": ...}
cloud.browsers.download_recording(s["id"], "session.mp4")
```

- `browsers`: `create(**options)`, `get(id)`, `list(status=, note=, limit=, before=)`, `stop(id)`,
  `live(id, control=False)`, `share(id, control=, minutes=, recording=)`,
  `handoff(id, reason=, timeout_sec=)`, `handoff_done(id)`, `wait_handoff(id, timeout=, poll=2.0)`,
  `events(id, after=0, limit=)`, `recording_url(id)`, `download_recording(id, path)`.
  `wait_handoff` on a session with no hand-off raises `CloudError` (code `NO_HANDOFF`).
- `runs`: `create(task, url=, schema=, secrets=, wait=True, timeout=, poll=1.5, on_update=, **options)`
  (the browser options above plus `max_steps`, `handoff`, `handoff_timeout_sec`), `get(id)`,
  `list(limit=, before=)`, `cancel(id)`, `wait(id, timeout=, poll=1.5, on_update=)`. A run that
  pauses for a person (`waiting_for_human`) is not finished: `on_update` hears about it, and without
  one the live link is printed to stderr.
- `profiles`: `list()`, `get(name)`, `delete(name)`, `import_cookies(name, cookies, mode="merge")`,
  `sync(name, from_profile=DIR | from_cdp=URL | from_file=PATH | login_url=URL, domains=[...] |
  all_domains=True, replace=False)`. `sync` refuses to run without `domains` or `all_domains=True`.
- `webhooks`: `create(url, events=, description=)` (the answer carries the `secret`, shown once),
  `list()`, `delete(id)`, `test(id)`

Every method returns the parsed JSON of its endpoint. An API refusal raises
`CloudError(status, code, message)` with the server's own message (`e.code` is e.g.
`"PROFILE_IN_USE"`); a wait that runs out raises `CloudTimeoutError`, whose `.last` holds the last
view (the run carries on on the server).

Check a webhook delivery with the raw request body and the `Clearcote-Signature` header:

```python

## Fingerprint options

All optional. Anything not listed here is passed straight through to Playwright
(`headless`, `proxy`, `args`, `timeout`, `slow_mo`, …).

| Kwarg | Switch | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `fingerprint` | `--fingerprint` | Master seed (per-eTLD+1 farbling root). `str` or `int`. |
| `platform` | `--fingerprint-platform` | `"windows"` \| `"linux"` \| `"macos"` \| `"android"` (best-effort mobile persona). |
| `platform_version` | `--fingerprint-platform-version` | UA-CH platform version. |
| `brand` | `--fingerprint-brand` | `"Chrome"` \| `"Edge"` \| `"Opera"` \| `"Vivaldi"`. |
| `brand_version` | `--fingerprint-brand-version` | Brand version. |
| `gpu_vendor` | `--fingerprint-gpu-vendor` | WebGL UNMASKED vendor. |
| `gpu_renderer` | `--fingerprint-gpu-renderer` | WebGL UNMASKED renderer. |
| `hardware_concurrency` | `--fingerprint-hardware-concurrency` | `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`. |
| `location` | `--fingerprint-location` | `"lat,lng"` (only when geo permission is granted). |
| `timezone` | `--timezone` | IANA timezone, e.g. `"America/New_York"`. |
| `accept_language` | `--accept-lang` | `navigator.languages` + `Accept-Language` header, e.g. `"en-US,en"`. |
| `webrtc_ip` | `--webrtc-ip` | WebRTC IP to report. The engine **fabricates** the `srflx` candidate at this IP and sends **no real STUN** from the host, so the real IP never leaks (not merely relabeled). |
| `disable_gpu_fingerprint` | `--disable-gpu-fingerprint` | Turn off GPU/WebGL spoofing. |
| `geoip` | _(directive)_ | `True` → resolve the proxy's exit-IP geo and auto-fill timezone/accept_language/location/**webrtc_ip**. |
| `fingerprint_profile` | _(directive → `--fingerprint-profile`)_ | A real captured machine profile (file path / dict / JSON string); the SDK gzip+base64-encodes it. Fields present **override** the seed-derived persona; absent fields fall back to `fingerprint`. Also derives `accept_language` from the profile's `navigator.languages` when none is set. |
| `canvas_bridge` | _(→ `--canvas-bridge-*`)_ | Forward canvas/WebGL readbacks to a remote real-GPU host so the pixels a page hashes match the GPU your persona claims. `{"url", "auth", "mode", "allow", "deny", "fallback"}`; setting `url` auto-adds `--no-sandbox`. See [docs/CANVAS-BRIDGE.md](../../docs/CANVAS-BRIDGE.md). |
| `extensions` | _(→ `--load-extension` + `--disable-extensions-except`)_ | List of unpacked-extension directory paths to load (Chromium forces headed when extensions are present). |
| `humanize` | _(directive)_ | `True` → humanize all input (move/click/drag/scroll/type) as native trusted events, at the page and locator level. See [Humanized input](#humanized-input-humanize-show_cursor). |
| `show_cursor` | _(directive)_ | `True` → inject a red cursor dot that follows the real mouse (handy for watching a headed run). |

> **Headed launches** default to `no_viewport=True` so `window.innerWidth` tracks the real OS window — an emulated `1280×720` on a real window is an impossible-window tell. Pass an explicit `viewport` to override.

> **Headless launches** (0.24.0+) get a coherent window geometry by default, so `screen`, `availWidth/Height`,
> `innerWidth/Height` and `outerWidth/Height` agree with each other the way a real window's do. With a
> `fingerprint` seed the engine's own screen and work area are used and the window is sized to them; without a
> seed the SDK sets the headless display to a screen size drawn from real captured desktops (with a
> taskbar on Windows) and sizes the window to its work area the same way. It is applied at launch,
> before your first navigation. Pass an explicit `viewport`, `screen` or `no_viewport` to opt out
> entirely.
>
> **Proxies:** a SOCKS5 proxy with credentials — written in the URL (`socks5://user:pass@host:port`) or passed as `username`/`password` — is routed via `--proxy-server` (Playwright rejects credentials in its SOCKS descriptor), and the credentials are passed to the engine, which implements SOCKS5 username/password authentication (RFC 1929). Stock Chromium does not, so no local relay is needed.

## Personas & Client Hints coherence

A persona's Client Hints are coherent across **JavaScript and HTTP by construction** — clearcote rewrites a single `blink::UserAgentMetadata` (brand list, full-version list, platform, mobile, arch/bitness) that feeds *both* the browser path that attaches the `Sec-CH-UA*` request headers **and** the renderer path that builds `navigator.userAgentData`. There aren't two sides to keep in sync; they read the same source. So `getHighEntropyValues(['fullVersionList', …])` in JS matches `Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version-List` on the wire, `userAgentData.platform` matches `Sec-CH-UA-Platform`, and so on.

**Chrome — the default and the recommendation** (most coherent: clearcote *is* Chromium, so the claim matches the engine's real behavior):

```python
browser = launch(fingerprint="p1")   # brand defaults to Chrome; platform defaults to the host OS
# HTTP:  sec-ch-ua: "Google Chrome";v="149", "Chromium";v="149", "Not)A;Brand";v="…"
#        sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0    sec-ch-ua-platform: "Windows"
# JS:    navigator.userAgentData.brands == that same list; mobile=False; platform="Windows"
```

**Edge** — a coherent Edge string surface (UA + UA-CH), for targets that specifically expect the Edge brand:

```python
browser = launch(fingerprint="p1", brand="Edge")
# UA:    …Chrome/149.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/149.0.0.0
# HTTP:  sec-ch-ua: "Microsoft Edge";v="149", "Chromium";v="149", "Not)A;Brand";v="…"
#        sec-ch-ua-full-version-list: "Microsoft Edge";v="149.0.3650.65", "Chromium";v="149.0.7827.114", …
# JS:    userAgentData.brands include "Microsoft Edge"; getHighEntropyValues(['fullVersionList'])
#        carries that same distinct Edge build — JS and HTTP identical, from one metadata.
```

`brand` (`"Chrome"` \| `"Edge"` \| `"Opera"` \| `"Vivaldi"`) is a **string-level** persona: it changes the UA + UA-CH brand, but the engine still behaves like Chromium. Chrome is the most coherent default (nothing to contradict); reach for `brand="Edge"` only when a target expects it. If you also set `brand_version` to an older major, the network `tls_profile` (default `match-persona`) shifts the TLS shape to that major while the JS engine stays at the build version — so **Chrome ≈ the build version, everything aligned** is the strongest persona.

**Android** — a best-effort mobile persona (seed-selected Pixel/Galaxy):

```python
browser = launch(fingerprint="p1", platform="android")   # auto-sets a phone --window-size
# UA:    …(Linux; Android 10; K) … Chrome/149.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36
# JS/HTTP: sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?1, platform="Android", model + platformVersion; maxTouchPoints=5,
#          pointer:coarse / hover:none, mobile screen + DPR, Mali/Adreno WebGL, plugins=0.
```

Android is **best-effort on a desktop engine**: the JS/header surface is coherent, but the GPU *render* and fine page geometry (`innerWidth` floors at ~500px) stay desktop — documented residual tells. Pair with `canvas_bridge` for render coherence.

## Saved profiles (`Profile`)

A `Profile` bundles a persona (seed, GPU, brand, …) **and** its `canvas_bridge` config under one
name you can persist and re-launch — the claimed GPU, the bridge endpoint, and the bridge's
GPU-keyed cache stay coherent because they travel together.

```python
from clearcote import Profile, launch

# save once
Profile("acct-1", {
    "fingerprint": "acct-1",
    "gpu_vendor": "Google Inc. (Intel)",
    "gpu_renderer": "ANGLE (Intel, Intel(R) UHD Graphics ... D3D11)",
    "canvas_bridge": {"url": "ws://127.0.0.1:9099", "auth": "user:secret"},
}).save()

# re-launch anywhere (explicit kwargs override the saved options)
browser = Profile.load("acct-1").launch(headless=False)
# equivalently: launch(profile="acct-1")
```

Profiles are JSON at `~/.clearcote/profiles/<name>.json` (set `CLEARCOTE_PROFILE_DIR` to relocate).

## API

- `launch(**options)` → Playwright `Browser`. Pass `profile=` (a name, path, or `Profile`) to launch a saved persona; `cloud=True` for a hosted browser ([Local or cloud](#local-or-cloud)).
- `launch_persistent_context(user_data_dir, **options)` → Playwright `BrowserContext`; `launch_persistent_context(cloud=True, profile="name")` for a cloud profile.
- `Cloud(api_key=None, base_url=None)` / `AsyncCloud` — the hosted API (`browsers`, `runs`, `profiles`, `webhooks`); `CloudError`, `CloudTimeoutError`, `verify_webhook(raw_body, signature_header, secret, tolerance_sec=300)`.
- `serve(**options)` → `Server` — a standing, stealthy CDP endpoint (`.cdp_url` / `.ws_url()` / `.close()`; context manager) any Playwright/Puppeteer/CDP client attaches to. Also exposed as the `clearcote-serve` CLI.
- `executable_path(executable_path=None, cache_dir=None, quiet=False)` → `str` — resolve (download/verify if needed) the chrome.exe path.
- `download(cache_dir=None, quiet=False)` → `str` — pre-fetch + verify without launching.
- `Profile` — `Profile(name, options)`, `.save(path=None)`, `Profile.load(name)`, `.launch(**overrides)`, `.launch_persistent_context(dir, **overrides)`; plus `list_profiles()`, `load_profile(name)`.
- `RELEASE` — the pinned release metadata (tag, version, sha256).

## Binary resolution & verification

`launch()` resolves the browser in this order:

1. `executable_path=` argument, if given;
2. `CLEARCOTE_BINARY` environment variable, if set;
3. otherwise **download** the pinned release, **verify its SHA-256** (the hash is baked into this
   package — it's the trust anchor), extract to a per-version cache, and verify the extracted
   `chrome.exe` hash too.

Cache location (override with `CLEARCOTE_CACHE`):
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\clearcote\Cache\<tag>`
- macOS: `~/Library/Caches/clearcote/<tag>`
- Linux: `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/clearcote/<tag>`

A SHA-256 mismatch is a hard error — the SDK refuses to run an unverified binary. You can
independently confirm the published checksums and GPG signatures on the
[release page](https://github.com/clearcotelabs/clearcote-browser/releases).

### Stay on the latest build (`auto_update`)

By default the SDK installs the **exact browser build pinned into this package** — reproducible,
and the baked-in SHA-256 is the trust anchor. To follow new browser releases **without upgrading
the package every time**, opt in:

```python
browser = launch(fingerprint="seed-123", auto_update=True)
```

or set the environment variable globally:

```bash
CLEARCOTE_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```

With `auto_update`, the SDK resolves the **newest GitHub release**, downloads its zip, and verifies
it against that release's published `SHA256SUMS.txt`. When a **`gpg`** binary is available it
additionally imports the release's public key, confirms its fingerprint equals the pinned
`CA96F185 F96A693A EDB3AC1F CB00D851 B7A86B0F`, and verifies the signed checksum — so an
auto-resolved build is cryptographically authenticated, not just downloaded. If GitHub is
unreachable it falls back to the pinned release; if the latest release *is* the pinned one, the
audited baked-in hashes are used. Each build is cached per tag, so this only downloads when a new
version actually ships. (For locked-down/reproducible deployments, leave `auto_update` off and bump
the package deliberately.)

## Choosing a browser version

By default the SDK downloads the exact build pinned into this package. To pick a specific browser
major/version instead, pass `version=` (or set `CLEARCOTE_BROWSER_VERSION`):

```python
launch(fingerprint="seed-1", version="150")      # newest 150.x (free)
launch(version="150.0.7871.114")                 # an exact build
launch(version="latest")                         # newest you can access
launch(version="150", license_key="cc_lic_...")  # a PRO-tier version (see below)
```

The request is resolved against a public catalog (`GET /api/v1/versions`) and **validated to exist
before anything downloads**, so a bad request fails fast instead of getting stuck:

- unknown version → `No Clearcote build matches version '151'. Available: 149.0.7827.114 (free).`
- a PRO-tier version without a key → `Clearcote 150… is a PRO build … set a license key (CLEARCOTE_LICENSE_KEY).`

Free versions download from GitHub (no key needed); PRO versions download via the authenticated route.
Each build is cached per version, so different majors coexist. Binary resolution order:
`executable_path` > `CLEARCOTE_BINARY` > `version` > pinned default. Works the same in the async API,
`executable_path()`, and `download()`.

## PRO tier (license key)

Everything above is the **free** build. A PRO license adds **floating-concurrency licensing** and
pulls a separate, license-gated browser build. It's opt-in and entirely additive — **with no
license key the SDK is byte-for-byte the free client** (free binary from GitHub, and it never
contacts the license backend).

### What's in each tier

<!-- The rows below mirror site/lib/tiers.ts, which is the single source of truth for the
     free/PRO split. If you change one, change the other (and the sibling SDK README). -->

The identity surface is **free in full**. A licence does not unlock "more spoofing" — every fingerprint
control below is in the open build. The licensed build adds behavioural realism that needs recorded
data or engine work held out of the public tree. **It is free with GitHub for one browser at a time**
(sign in at [clearcotelabs.com](https://clearcotelabs.com/pricing#free), needs SDK 0.29.0+); **PRO**
runs up to 250 browsers at once and adds email support.

| Capability | Open source | Free with GitHub | PRO |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Seeded personas (`fingerprint`), per-site farbling | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Canvas / WebGL / audio / font identity controls | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| All 18 metadata overrides (`screen_width`, `device_memory`, `gpu_vendor`, …) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `light_stealth` preset | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| TLS ClientHello profile (`tls_profile`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Proxy + `geoip` locale/timezone coherence | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Humanized input (`humanize`) — synthetic bézier paths | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Humanized input — real recorded human trajectories** | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Coalesced pointer samples** (`getCoalescedEvents` realism) | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Coherent WebRTC srflx fabrication** (`webrtc_ip`) | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| **WebRTC host-candidate concealment** (`.local` names) | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Request-header hygiene** on revalidation | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Floating-concurrency licensing + run-token gate | — | 1 browser | ✅ up to 250 |
| Email support from the owner | — | — | ✅ |

The mouse tier is decided **at runtime** from a signed claim in the run-token — same SDK call,
same `humanize=True`. With a valid PRO lease the motion comes from recorded human trajectories;
without one it falls back to the synthetic bézier path. Nothing in your code changes.

Pass a `license_key` (or set `CLEARCOTE_LICENSE_KEY`, or drop it in `~/.clearcote/license.key`):

```python
browser = launch(fingerprint="seed-123", license_key="cc_lic_...")
```

When a key is present the SDK:

1. **downloads the PRO binary** via the site's authenticated `GET /api/v1/download/pro` route
   (short-lived signed URL), verified against its SHA-256 exactly like the free pin, then cached;
2. **checks out one concurrency slot** — a background heartbeat keeps it alive and rotates a
   short-lived run-token, and the slot is released when the browser closes.

The PRO engine refuses to launch without a valid run-token, so a copied binary alone won't run.
Resolution order for the binary is **`executable_path` → `CLEARCOTE_BINARY` → PRO (licensed) →
free** — an explicit binary always wins. A revoked/expired key raises (`ConcurrencyLimitError` /
`LicenseRevokedError` / `LicenseError`); it never silently downgrades to the free binary. Override
the backend with `license_api_base` or `CLEARCOTE_LICENSE_API`. Works the same in the async API.
